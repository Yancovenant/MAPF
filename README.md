## üöÄ First-Time Installation

### 1. Unity Setup

- Download and import MAPF.unitypackage on this repo.
- If you starting a new unity project, be sure to name it `MAPF` for simpler integration for this repo.
- Open the `MAPF` or /yourprojectname folder in Unity Hub.
- Let Unity import and compile all assets.
- NativeWebSocket Dependancies, how to install -> [How to install NativeWebSocket](#how-to-install-)
- Go to Scene/MainScene and on Hierarcy tab, select -> EnvStart/GlobalProperties.
- Fill in the backend server configuration to any best given recommendation, when you start the server -> @see [First Time Backend Config](#backend-first-time-config)

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```sh
# Open terminal and cd to the folder where you want the project
cd /path/to/your/projects # Make sure that you cd to your unity project parent first.
```

**!Important!**
rename your project unity into 'MAPF'.
otherwise you need to copy&paste the /Backend and /Assets folder to your project.

or simply create a new unity project and name it to 'MAPF'

**Make sure that before cloning this repository to 'cd' to your path project first, to make sure that unity & backend is integrated completly without any future error.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Yancovenant/MAPF.git
```

---

### 3. Python Backend Setup

> **Backend is inside the `Backend/` folder.**

#### a. Install backend dependencies

```sh
cd Backend

# Install backend
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or simpy do

pip install -e .
```

---

### 4. Running the Backend Server

```sh
# From the Backend folder
python -m webapp
# or
uvicorn webapp.ASGI:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --workers 2
```
- The backend will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Unity will connect to the backend automatically.

#### Backend first time config.
- When it is the very first time your machine start the backend server, it would automatically run the test itself to determine the best config setup that you can use in your current device resources.
- Make sure to update it directly inside the unity scene -> GlobalProperties gameObject.

### 5. Unity Build/Run

- Press **Play** in the Unity Editor to start the simulation.

---

## üß© Dependencies

### Unity
- [NativeWebSocket](https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket) (for agent-backend communication)
- No extra Unity packages required (all scripts included)

#### How to Install ?
- Window -> Assets/Package Management
- [Top Left Corner] (+) plus icon, add from git url
```sh
https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket.git#upm
```

### Python Backend
- Python 3.10+
- See `Backend/requirements.txt` for all packages:
  - `ultralytics` (YOLO)
  - `opencv-python`
  - `starlette`, `uvicorn`
  - `websockets`, `wsproto`
  - `numba`, `psutil`
  - and more...

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Features

- **Multi-agent A* pathfinding** with conflict resolution
- **YOLO obstacle detection** (Python backend)
- **Map editor** (web frontend, Konva.js)
- **Live agent monitoring** (web dashboard)
- **Dynamic map loading** (Unity + backend)
- **WebSocket communication** (Unity <-> Python)
- **Warehouse/road placement rules** (map editor)
- **Local storage for map drafts**
- **Client input AUGV's routes**

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Code Design

- **Async & Coroutines:**
  - Unity uses coroutines for agent movement and camera capture to avoid blocking the main thread.
  - Backend uses async WebSocket and Starlette for high concurrency.
- **Object Pooling:**
  - Reduces memory allocations and garbage collection in Unity.
- **Lockstep Simulation:**
  - Ensures all agents move in sync, preventing deadlocks and race conditions.
- **Efficient Pathfinding:**
  - Custom A* implementation, optimized for grid and node reuse.
- **Minimized Memory Leaks:**
  - Careful cleanup of textures, threads, and sockets in Unity and backend.
- **Batch Processing:**
  - Backend processes frames and detections in batches for better throughput.
- **Numba JIT:**
  - Backend uses Numba to speed up critical math functions.
- **Onstart Config:**
  - Backend for the very first time, will run the test itself to recommend:
    - The best FPS for your current device;
    - The best YOLO model (onnx, pt);
    - The best inference method (threading, multi-processing);
    - The best maximum number of AUGV that will use YOLO.

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands

```sh
# Start backend server
cd Backend
python -m webapp

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or
pip install -e .

# Activate Unity project
# (Open MAPF folder in Unity Hub)
```

---

## üìù Notes

- **Backend is NOT included in Unity builds.**  
  Deploy/copy the `Backend/` folder separately if needed.
- **For development:**  
  Always run both Unity and the backend server.
- **For map editing:**  
  Use the web editor at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
